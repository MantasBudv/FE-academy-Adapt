*** EXERCISE BRIEF ***

You found a lonely cat who is desperate to get some snacks. She wants to pass the road (right to left).
1. Draw the road for her horizontally thoughout the page by using CSS
2. The road should have mid-road lane.
3. Put three snacks throughout the road (in the beginning, middle and the end)
4. When hovering mouse on the road, the cat should move to the other side
5. If you are feeling funky show how the cat grows while getting the snacks, not literally, ofcourse. (grows in size) - transform: scale();
